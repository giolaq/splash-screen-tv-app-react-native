# Lottie Animation on Splash Screen sample app for Fire TV in React Native

This project is a React Native app showcasing how to develop a Splash Screen with a Lottie animation for Fire TV apps. Follow the guide and check this repository to develop your custom splash screen.

**Note:** Fire OS is based on the [Android Open Source project version 11](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/about/android-11-release) so you should not use Android 12's new SplashScreen APIs as described in [the Android v12 docs](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/splash-screen).
